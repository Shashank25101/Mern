1) What is Java?
Ans: Java is a platform-independent high-level programming language. It is platform-independent because its byte codes can run on any system regardless of its operating system.
2) What are the OOP concepts?
Ans: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction
3)What is Abstraction in Java?
Ans: In Java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.
Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviours of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.
4)What is Encapsulation in Java?
Ans: Encapsulation in Java is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, which is called a class in Java. Java Encapsulation is a way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class.
5)What is Inheritance in Java?
Ans: In Java, Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. In Java, Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well.
